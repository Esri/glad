# This is a change tracked .gitignore file which specifies what files
# git should ignore adding to the stage and committing.  There is also
# an untracked internal ".gitignore" file called .git/info/exclude which
# will contain any global ignores and is modified by the clone_or_pull_repos
# script.  If you find that there is a file that you need to be change
# tracked but falls into one of these ignore regular expressions, you can
# still un-ignore it with a !.  For example, if test.sln is needed to be
# committed, you can add !test.sln to your project's .gitignore file to
# allow it to be staged, committed and tracked.
